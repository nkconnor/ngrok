# ngrok &emsp; ![Build] [![Crate]](https://crates.io/crates/ngrok) [![Docs]](https://docs.rs/ngrok/)

[build]: https://github.com/nkconnor/ngrok/workflows/tests/badge.svg
[crate]: https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ngrok
[docs]: https://docs.rs/ngrok/badge.svg

A minimal and concise [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) wrapper for Rust. The library has many use cases, for example:
- open public HTTP tunnels to your development server(s) for integrations tests
- simplified networking and development on devices like a Raspberry Pi

TCP support, while not available, should be trivial to support.

This has been tested with Linux and we assume that it does not work on Windows (contributions
welcome!).

## Getting Started

```toml
[dependencies]
ngrok = "0.5.0"
```

## Usage

```rust
use ngrok;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let tunnel = ngrok::builder()
        .http()
        .port(3030)
        .run()?;

    let public_url: url::Url = tunnel.http()?;

    println!("Tunnel is open at {:?}", public_url);

    Ok(())
}
```

This assumes that `ngrok` is on your path. To change this, use the `.executable()` method in the builder when
creating your tunnel.
